# JimDOS
A simple DOS-Like OS built on COSMOS in C# (C Sharp).

## Getting it yourself
Download the ISO from releases. The ISO can be run in a virtual machine as it is bootable. You may also burn it to a USB or CD and boot it on a physical device, but this is not recommended as it is still in testing.
